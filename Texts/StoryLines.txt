Today has been quite a day...
...
My fianc√© was expecting an important call but didn't receive any. 
She didn't let me know, but I could tell she feels sad.
My dog, Haia, she died last week.
After spending every day together for 15 years, she's gone. 
Man...
When did life get so hard?
My boss keeps reminding me of a mistake I made two months ago.
 It wasn't anything too terrible, honestly. But I think he just needs someone to blame, and for some reason, it has to be me.
I feel really down today...
And yet, instead of spending time with my love, assuring her everything is going to be okay - I am here.
Stuck in the middle of forest....
I can't wait to get home.
'Oh shoot!' .... 'Where are they?'
....
'You have to be kidding... '
'John, you idiot... You left the keys to your car in that hecking cabin'
Great... I promised Sarah I was going to be home early today.
Hope I can find the way to that cabin...I have terrible memory.
Okay John. Breathe in... Calm down... It's not so far away!
