Hmm... I hope I can get back to my car before sunset. I have head full of thoughts... So much is happening.
If I only paid attention walking there...
Hmm...The path is splitting here. Okay, which way was it?... Left or right? Think John, think!
I think it was left... Left! Yeah, this path seems familiar.... It reminds me, the forest where me and Sarah Took Haia to walk every friday... We used to talk about our week while Haia silently walked near us... But all forests looks the same.
+Right! It was this path for sure... I think... I can see something in there... Uh, what is it ? Ah, I have to walk carefully, there is some hillside. Similar to when I was 6. Back then I fell in there and I broke my arm.I remember my dad being super-angry with me. What a summer.
>Stairs... This place is so peaceful. Climbing stairs... Kind of irony. I am climbing corporate stairs. These stairs feel easier to climb of course. Ahahah... man will my boss ever stop being so harsh?...
>-Here I am... crying about my job in quiet forest... Damn.. I am probably really overwhelmed. Haia is gone... At home Sarah barelly talks to me.... and at work I am that wierd outsider that gets yelled at by his boss. I don't even know what word would describe my feeling...Empty... Lost...Sad... Depressed? .... Stressed? ....Yeah... stressed...So, left or right?
>A wall? It looks old. I want to sit down here for a while. Hearing the wind... The feeling of loneliness... Oh, first star appeared on the sky. It's getting late. Stars... objects so far away... They are so big and yet, we barelly see them from here with our bare eyes. \nBeautiful. Well... let's keep moving.
>I think... All bad is eventually good for someting. While ago... I was mad about forgetting keys... Now I am kind of glad. \nBeing outside, alone... \nIt brings me wierd peace. A place to sort my thoughts out.
>Damn it... I am really lucky today. Blocked path. Well.. The path is ending here... I can return to the  place where the path was splitting.
>So lets head to right... I hear some noises comming from here. Like water...?
-Oh...A fountain. Here? With the sky full of stars... This feeels like from another world... Isn't that funny? Us... people... We feel like there is too much to handle in our life. Then, when you look at the skies, full of beautiful stars, and you realize how small you are... How small your whole life is in grand scheme... Thoughts like this ...Makes one feel so small yet so lost.
-A wall? I think I passed by some wall last time. I think I am getting closer to that cabin.
-I can see the cabin! It did not even take ma that long to find it.
-Just a few steps away...
-Here they are. Small keys for small problem in my even smaller life.
-happy end-You know what? I am actually glad I came here... I did not imagine spending afternoon here, but walking here... thinking about the weight of my problems... made me feel better... I feel lonely, sad, yet.. calm..-ish... Life is unpredictable and so is our journey in it...Right?
+The air is so fresh here. The wind... The trees... The silence.. Silence that is louder than brothers kids screaming on the playground.
+A waterfall. I don't think I passed by one before. Maybe I didn't notice? Its kind of small. I might have passed here without noticing...right?
+Oh...A fountain. Here? With the sky full of stars... This feeels like from another world...Heh, isn't that funny? Us... people... We feel like there is too much to handle in our life. Then, when you look at the skies, full of beautiful stars, and you realize how small you are... How small your whole life is in grand scheme... Thoughts like this ...Makes one feel so small yet so lost. So, John, left or right?
+!A cabin! Hmm.. If I only paid attention first time here... I don't think I was in this cabin. But I have to make sure. Funny I know. 'John how can you not remember where have you been 30 minutes ago?' Well I would get lost even in my own garden.
+!It's locked!
++!I will go back to that fountain.
+_Sarah... My dear. I can't stop thinking about you... About us. About our journey in life... We've been throught so much. When your dad passed away, alot has changed. You took care of your mom... while pausing your career. I know you two were close... I wish I could have done more for you. I wish I could have taken away your sadness. I wish I could do more for you right now... ... ... I love you. I really hope your medication will help you feel again. My love, my hero, my life, I am on my way home.
+_A wall? I think I passed by some wall last time. I think I am getting closer to that cabin.
+_This place look so cold. There is mud everywhere. Ahh.... I will get my car dirty. Cool. So.. left or right?
+_I can't go there!
+_!Let's take a few steps back and go the other way.
