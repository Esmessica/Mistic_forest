Hmm... I hope I can get back to my car before sunset. I have head full of thoughts... So much is happening.
If I only paid attention during this walk...
Hmm...The path is splitting here. Okay, which way was it?... Left or right? Think John, think!
I think it was left... Left! Yeah, this path seems familiar.... It reminds me, the forest where me and Sarah Took Haia to walk every friday... We used to talk about our week while Haia silently walked near us... But all forests looks the same.
Right! It was this path for sure... I think... I can see something in there... \n Uh, what is it ? Ah, I have to walk carefully, there is some hillside. Similar to when I was 6. Back then I fell in there and I broke my arm.\nI remember my dad being superangry with me. \nWhat a summer.
