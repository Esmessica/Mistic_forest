Hmm... I hope I can get back to my car before sunset. I have head full of thoughts... So much is happening.
If I only paid attention walking there...
Hmm...The path is splitting here. Okay, which way was it?... Left or right? Think John, think!
>I think it was left... Left! Yeah, this path seems familiar.... It reminds me, the forest where me and Sarah Took Haia to walk every friday... We used to talk about our week while Haia silently walked near us... But all forests looks the same.
Right! It was this path for sure... I think... I can see something in there... Uh, what is it ? Ah, I have to walk carefully, there is some hillside. Similar to when I was 6. Back then I fell in there and I broke my arm.I remember my dad being superangry with me. What a summer.
>Stairs... This place is so peaceful. Climbing stairs... Kind of irony. I am climbing corporate stairs. These stairs feel easier to climb of course. Ahahah... man will my boss ever stop being so harsh?...
>Here I am... crying about my job in quiet forest... Damn.. I am probably really overwhelmed. Haia is gone... At home Sarah barelly talks to me.... and at work I am that wierd outsider that gets yelled at by his boss. I don't even know what word would describe my feeling...Empty... Lost...Sad... Depressed? .... Stressed? ....Yeah... stressed...So, left or right?
>A wall? It looks old. I want to sit down here for a while. Hearing the wind... The feeling of loneliness... Oh, first star appeared on the sky. It's getting late. Stars... objects so far away... They are so big and yet, we barelly see them from here with our bare eyes. \nBeautiful. Well... let's keep moving.
>I think... All bad is eventually good for someting. While ago... I was mad about forgetting keys... Now I am kind of glad. \nBeing outside, alone... \nIt brings me wierd peace. A place to sort my thoughts out.
>Damn it... I am really lucky today. Blocked path. Well.. The path is ending here... I can return to the  place where the path was splitting.
>So lets head to right... I hear some noises comming from here. Like water...?
