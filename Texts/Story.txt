Hmm... The fading sunlight casts long shadows, mirroring the heaviness of my thoughts. So much is happening...
If only I had paid closer attention during my journey here, perhaps I wouldn't be grappling with this frustrating situation. But life's distractions have a way of blurring our perceptions, leaving us disoriented in the midst of our own minds. Don't they?
Hmm...The path is splitting here. Okay, which way was it? ...   Left or right? Think, John, think!
I think it was left... Left! Yeah, this path seems familiar.... It reminds me of the forest where me and Sarah took Haia to walk every Friday... We used to talk about our week while Haia silently walked near us... But all forests look the same.
+Right! It was this path for sure... I think... I can see something in there... Uh, what is it? Ah, I have to walk carefully; there is some hillside. Similar to when I was 6. Back then, I fell in there and broke my arm. I remember my dad being super angry with me. What a summer.
>Stairs... This place is so peaceful. Climbing stairs... Kind of irony. I am climbing corporate stairs. These stairs feel easier to climb, of course. Ahahah... man, will my boss ever stop being so harsh?...
>-Here I am... crying about my job in a quiet forest... Damn.. I am probably really overwhelmed. Haia is gone... At home, Sarah barely talks to me.... and at work, I am that weird outsider that gets yelled at by his boss. I don't even know what word would describe my feeling... Empty... Lost...Sad... Depressed? .... Stressed? ....Yeah... stressed... So, left or right?
>A wall? It looks old. I want to sit down here for a while. Hearing the wind... The feeling of loneliness... Oh, the first star appeared in the sky. It's getting late. Stars... objects so far away... They are so big, and yet, we barely see them from here with our bare eyes. Beautiful. Well, let's keep moving.
>I think... All bad is eventually good for something. A while ago, I was mad about forgetting keys... Now I am kind of glad. Being outside, alone... It brings me weird peace. A place to sort my thoughts out.
>Damn it... I am really lucky today. Blocked path. Well, the path is ending here. I can return to the place where the path was splitting.
>So let's head right... I hear some noises coming from here. Like water...?
-Oh... A fountain. Here? With the sky full of stars... This feels like it's from another world... Isn't that funny? Us... people... We feel like there is too much to handle in our lives. Then, when you look at the skies, full of beautiful stars, and you realize how small you are—how small your whole life is in the grand scheme... Thoughts like this make one feel so small yet so lost.
-A wall? I think I passed by some wall last time. I think I'm getting closer to that cabin.
-I can see the cabin! It did not even take me that long to find it.
-Just a few steps away...
-Here they are. Small keys for small problems in my even smaller life.
-happy end- You know what? I am actually glad I came here... I did not imagine spending an afternoon here, but walking here... thinking about the weight of my problems... made me feel better... I feel lonely, sad, yet.. calm..-ish... Life is unpredictable, and so is our journey in it...Right?
+The air is so fresh here. The wind... the trees... the silence.. Silence that is louder than kids screaming on the playground.
+A waterfall. I don't think I passed by one before. Maybe I didn't notice? It's kind of small. I might have passed here without noticing...right?
+Oh...A fountain. Here? With the sky full of stars... This feels like it's from another world... Heh, isn't that funny? Us... people... We feel like there is too much to handle in our lives. Then, when you look at the skies, full of beautiful stars, and you realize how small you are... How small your whole life is in grand scheme... Thoughts like this make one feel so small yet so lost. So, John, left or right?
+!A cabin! Hmm.. If I only paid attention the first time here... I don't think I was in this cabin. But I have to make sure. Funny I know. 'John how can you not remember where you were 30 minutes ago?' Well, I would get lost even in my own garden.
+!It's locked!
++!I will go back to that fountain.
+_Sarah... My dear. I can't stop thinking about you... About us. About our journey in life... We've been through so much. Since your dad passed away, alot has changed. You took care of your mom... while pausing your career. I knew you two were close... I wish I could have done more for you. I wish I could have taken away your sadness. I wish I could do more for you right now... ... ... I love you. I really hope your medication will help you feel better again. My love, my hero, my life, I am on my way home.
+_A wall? I think I passed by some wall last time. I think I'm getting closer to that cabin.
+_This place looks so cold. There is mud everywhere. Ahh.... I will get my car dirty. Cool. So.. left or right?
+_I can't go there! Let's take a few steps back and go the other way.
