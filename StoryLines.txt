Today was quite a day...
...
My fianc√©, she was expecting an important call, but didn't recieve any.
She didn't let it know, but I could tell she feels sad.
My dog - Haia, she died last week.
After 15 years of spending every day together, she's gone.
Man...
When did life got so hard?
My boss keeps reminding me of a mistake I've made two months ago.
It was not anything that bad, honestly. But I think he just needs someone to blame. For some reason, it has to be me.
I feel really down today...
And yet instead of spending time with my love, assuring her everything is going to be okay - I am here.
Stuck in the middle of forest....
I can't wait to get home.
'Oh shoot!' .... 'Where are they?'
....
'You have to be kidding... '
'John, you idiot... You left the keys to your car in that hecking cabin'
Great... I promised to Sarah I am gonna be home early today.
Hope I can find the way to that cabin...I have terrible memory.
Okay John. Breathe in... Calm down... It's not so far away!
